This directory contains the files for support in the ipfw backend.

Supported platforms:
- Mac OS X up to version 10.6 Snow Leopard
- FreeBSD (with firewall_enable="YES" in /etc/rc.conf)

The ipfw backend uses the standard ipfw API through setsockopt/getsockopt calls.
On FreeBSD, the backend will try to use SOCK_RAW socket first, and fallback to
SOCK_DGRAM if needed.
